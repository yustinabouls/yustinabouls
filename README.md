# Hello, World! 👋 I'm Yustina B.

### I'm a recent Computer Programming graduate from Durham College, with a driving passion for code, design, and problem-solving.

Coding for me is like painting for an artist or composing music for a musician - it's my way of creating, expressing, and most importantly, impacting.

🎓 I've honed my skills through a variety of academic projects - everything from card games to hospital management systems.  
🏗️ My tech toolbelt includes a rich assortment of languages and frameworks, with a strong focus on web development technologies.  
🎨 When I'm not deep in code, you can find me creating beautiful art pieces. You can check out my work [here](https://www.instagram.com/artbyyustina/)! I also foster positive educational environments as an art teacher.
